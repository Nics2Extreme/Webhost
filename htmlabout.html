            <h2>HyperText Markup Language</h2>
            <p>
                HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. 
                It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It's also worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language as it can't create dynamic functionality. It is now considered an official web standard. 
                The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates.
